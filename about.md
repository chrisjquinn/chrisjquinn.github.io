## Bio
I am a Msc student at the University of Warwick studying Cyber Security Engineering, apart of <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/" target="_blank">WMG</a>. I'm interested in security, UI, graph theory and data forensics. 


In the past, I've been an undergrad at Warwick in Discrete Mathematics. During my undergrad, I served on the executive comittees for <a href="https://www.warwicklifesaving.co.uk" target="_blank">Warwick Lifesaving</a> and the <a href="https://www.brasssoc.com" target="_blank">Brass Society</a>.


This website serves as blog posts for some work I have recently finished, plus a few other personal interests.
