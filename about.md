## Bio

Currently working at <a href="https://www.elliptic.co" target="_blank">Elliptic</a> as a Cryptocurrency Intelligence Analyst. I am interested in cypto (both -ography and -currency), digital forensics, graph theory and basically all things cyber.

In the past, I completed a masters in Cyber Security Engineering and bachelours in Discrete Mathematics at the University of Warwick. During my undergrad, I served on the executive comittees for <a href="https://www.warwicklifesaving.co.uk" target="_blank">Warwick Lifesaving</a> and the <a href="https://www.brasssoc.com" target="_blank">Brass Society</a>.
