## Bio

Currently working at <a href="https://www.elliptic.co" target="_blank">Elliptic</a> as the Intelligence Collection Lead. I am interested in blockchain analytics, digital forensics and basically all things cyber.

In the past, I completed a masters in Cyber Security Engineering and bachelours in Discrete Mathematics at the University of Warwick.


This website serves as blog posts for essentially tinkering I have done, findings I am able to disclose, plus a few other personal interests.
